# terminal_monitor
A Go project for monitoring system data in the terminal using a terminal UI package.

Everything should be included here if you have Go installed on your system.


Run with:
go run main.go system.go view.go

For now, the README.md is going to be a little empty as I add features. 

go run main.go systemInformation.go
